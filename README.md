## What is Python Scheduler?
Python Scheduler is a scheduling library in Python.

### Platforms
- Cross Platform.

### Dependencies
#### General
- Python.

## Motivation
Many times I want to schedule a Python script to open it everyday at the same hour. However, using Windows' task scheduler from Python can result quite verbose and hard. Python Scheduler attempts to solve that problem by providing a scheduler written in Python to set your tasks quickly.

## Installation and usage
To build and install Python Scheduler from source you must follow the next steps:
1. Clone the repo.
2. Set `main.pyw` to run on startup:
  1. Create a shortcut to `main.pyw`.
  2. Put the shortcut in your startup directory.
3. You're done!
